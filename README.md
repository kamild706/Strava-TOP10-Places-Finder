# Strava Top10 Places Finder

This application allows you to find all
segments where you take a place among Top 10 riders in the segment's leader board.

Segment will be included if it existed at the time the activity was uploaded to Strava.

In order to run this you must create your own API application in Strava's settings and provide its
`CLIENT_SECRET` and `CLIENT_ID` in the `src/config.js` file as shown in `src/config.js.template`.
